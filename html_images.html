<h2>HELLO WORLD</h2>
<p>: Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although 
there are days we wish there was a manual to follow, it simply wouldnâ€™t be the same 
without the spontaneity. The journey of life may not become easier as we grow 
older, but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve.</p>
